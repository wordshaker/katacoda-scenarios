Now we have our network setup, lets get our stack set up. 

## Our monitoring stack

We will be using StatsD for telemetry, and Graphite as our data source behind Grafana, our choice of visualisation tool.

[StatsD](https://github.com/etsy/statsd) was created by Etsy. It's a background process that listens for messages on a UDP port, which it then parses / aggregates and, in this case, passes on to Graphite. StatsD is well supported, lightweight & not overly complex.

[Graphite](http://graphiteapp.org/) is the next layer of the stack. Graphite is composed of Carbon, Whisper and Graphite-Web. Carbon listens for the time-series data (from StatsD), Whisper stores the data and Graphite-Web is the API for rendering graphs and visualisations, and has its own UI for creating them.

## Â Run Graphite, Carbon and StatsD

The images for Graphite and StatsD should have been pulled down in the background when you started this course using `docker pull graphiteapp/graphite-statsd`.

## Task 

To run them, enter the following command into the terminal

`docker run -d --name graphite -p 80:80 -p 2003-2004:2003-2004 -p 2023-2024:2023-2024 -p 8125:8125/udp -p 8126:8126 --network monitoring graphiteapp/graphite-statsd`{{execute}}


### A break down of the above command

* `docker run -d --name graphite` 

Runs the docker container in detached mode with the name `graphite`. By running in detached mode, the container runs in the background and exits when the root process used to run the container exits.

* `-p 80:80 -p 2003-2004:2003-2004 -p 2023-2024:2023-2024 -p 8125:8125/udp -p 8126:8126`

These are the port mappings. `-p` publishes the ports which maps a container port (right) to a port on the Docker host (left). By default these connections use TCP, but you can instruct UDP to be used using `/udp`. Here, the port the StatsD port uses is set to use UDP. This is the default and advised behaviour for this particular connection.

* `--network monitoring`

The network that the container needs to be a part of.

* `graphiteapp/graphite-statsd`

The image pulled from Docker Hub.
